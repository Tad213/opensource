	<h1>PlayStation Jailbreak</h1>
	<li><a style="color:#0000FF" href="http://opensource.orionhub.org:8000/">Home</a></li>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		A jailbroken PS is able to run unsigned code much like a <a href="http://opensource.orionhub.org:8000/IOS/index2.html">jailbroken iphone
		</a>. The differance being ovbiously this is a console so I normaly compare the end result to a <a href="http://opensource.orionhub.org:8000/Xbox/index2.html">
		RGHed xbox</a>, which also means no PSN and you can't dual boot, you can however spoof your FW but I will not get into that here you can google
		that up if you want.
	</p>
	<h2>What you need</h2>
	<li>A PS3 on OFW 4.66</li>
	<li>A Flash Drive with at least 256mb</li>
	<li><a href="http://j.gs/4Npp">these files</a></li>
	<h2>How to</h2>
	<p>
		Plug in your Flash drive, create a new folder on the root of the flash drive called "PS3", inside the folder 
		make another folder called "UPDATE". Now unzip the zip you downloaded into the update file it should end up
		being called "PS3UPDAT.PUP", then safely eject the USB and plug it into your PS3. Just navigate to Settings
		tab, click system update, chose update via media storage, it should say found "Version 4.66-JB" if it doesn't
		say exactly that repeate all the steps! If it says that click Ok and then Accept Conditions and Install Update
		MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LOOSE POWER! After a minute you should hear 4 beeps then it turns off, power it on by the console
		and you're done!
