	Now that you've got a jailbroken device, lets get to the fun stuff. Here, you will find some favorite tweaks. Also, if you're completely new to all this stuff and don't know what a tweak is, keep reading. A tweak is the name of a downloaded app that you get through Cydia which should automatically show up on your dashboard after you jailbreak your device. Lets begin...
	</br></br></br><b>Winterboard:</b> Winterboard is a MUST HAVE tweak. Once you download this, nothing really happens. That is because it is the app used to download 'themes' onto. A theme is something that changes the overall look of your device. So, if you're not 100% sure what I mean by that go ahead and download it, along with one other thing I tell you to download within Cydia, a theme. Now that you have Winterboard, go to Cydia, go to the search bar, and type in "Circulus." Once you've downloaded it, go into settings, scroll down a bit, and you should see the tab "Winterboard." Click that, and then turn on circulus. As soon as you turn it on, in the top right you should see the words "respring." Press that, and your phone will reset, it should only take about 10 seconds. Now look at your Homescreen. Need I explain more?
