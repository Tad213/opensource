	<font color="white">Now that you've got a jailbroken device, lets get to the fun stuff. Here, you will find some favorite tweaks. Also, if you're completely new to all this stuff and don't know what a tweak is, keep reading. A tweak is the name of a downloaded app that you get through Cydia which should automatically show up on your dashboard after you jailbreak your device. Lets begin...</font>
	<font color="white"></br></br></br><b>Winterboard:</b> Winterboard is a MUST HAVE tweak. Once you download this, nothing really happens. That is because it is the app used to download 'themes' onto. A theme is something that changes the overall look of your device. So, if you're not 100% sure what I mean by that go ahead and download it, along with one other thing I tell you to download within Cydia, a theme. Now that you have Winterboard, go to Cydia, go to the search bar, and type in "Circulus." Once you've downloaded it, go into settings, scroll down a bit, and you should see the tab "Winterboard." Click that, and then turn on circulus. As soon as you turn it on, in the top right you should see the words "respring." Press that, and your phone will reset, it should only take about 10 seconds. Now look at your Homescreen. Need I explain more?</font>

	<font color="white"><b>Movie Box:</b> If the name itself wasn't obvious enough, the app Movie Box essentially lets you watch most tv shows and/or movies. FOR FREE. To download this app it's a little more complicated, so listen carefully. Open Cydia, click the manage tab at the bottom. Once you get there, press 'edit' and then add. As soon as you click that a thing will appear that says..."http://" I want you to type in "repo.biteyourapple.net". Then add source. A source enables certain things that im not going to go into right now. Now you go to the search bar and type in "Movie Box." Download that, respring, and the icon should automatically show up on your dashboard. Also i'm pretty sure when you go to donwload it, it says something like 'do you trust this app'. Just click yes.</font>
