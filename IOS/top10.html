	<font color="white">Now that you've got a jailbroken device, lets get to the fun stuff. Here, you will find some of our favorite tweaks. Also, if you're completely new to all this stuff and don't know what a tweak is, keep reading. A tweak is the name of a downloaded app that you get through Cydia which should automatically show up on your dashboard after you jailbreak your device. Lets begin...</font>
	<font color="white"></br></br></br><b>Winterboard:</b> Winterboard is a MUST HAVE tweak. Once you download this, nothing really happens. That is because it is the app used to download 'themes' onto. A theme is something that changes the overall look of your device. So, if you're not 100% sure what I mean by that go ahead and download it, along with one other thing I tell you to download within Cydia, a theme. Now that you have Winterboard, go to Cydia, go to the search bar, and type in "Circulus." Once you've downloaded it, go into settings, scroll down a bit, and you should see the tab "Winterboard." Click that, and then turn on circulus. As soon as you turn it on, in the top right you should see the words "respring." Press that, and your phone will reset, it should only take about 10 seconds. Now look at your Homescreen. Need I explain more?</font> 
</p>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>Movie Box:</b> If the name itself wasn't obvious enough, the app Movie Box essentially lets you watch most tv shows and/or movies. FOR FREE. To download this app it's a little more complicated, so listen carefully. Open Cydia, click the manage tab at the bottom. Once you get there, press 'edit' and then add. As soon as you click that a thing will appear that says..."http://" I want you to type in "repo.biteyourapple.net". Then add source. A source enables certain things that im not going to go into right now. Now you go to the search bar and type in "Movie Box." Download that, respring, and the icon should automatically show up on your dashboard. Also i'm pretty sure when you go to donwload it, it says something like 'do you trust this app'. Just click yes.</font>

	<font color="white"><b>Cylinder:</b> Cylinder is another must have. When you swipe on your homescreen, obviously, it will boringly transition to the next page. But, with Cylinder, you can turn on certain things so that it has a really cool transition. This is a very simple and must have tweak, be sure to type in, and download it. </font>
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>Alkaline:</b> Look up in the top right of your phone....See that? Yes, it's a boring battey icon. If you want to jazz up that icon download Alkaline in the Cydia store. Alkaline is like Winterboard, you download themes onto the app. Although, it does come with some cool themes for your battery indicator that is sure to make you iPhone less disgusting.</font>
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>NoSlowAnimations:</b> This is a tweak I personally do not use, but many find it to be a great tweak. As the name implies, no more slow animations. For example; when you do double tap the home button on your device (iOS 7+) it will transition to the screen where you can slide up on apps that are running and get rid of them. It does this in a rather slow time and with NoSlowAnimations you can speed all the animations up!
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>iCleaner:</b> This has to be one of the best tweaks ever. This tweak, when used, cleans up unnecessary things such as your cache. Also, if there is something in specific you dont want the app to clean up, you can change the settings as to what it cleans. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>StatusHUD 2:</b> Ever been watching a YouTube video and want to turn the volume up or down? Then when you do the big icon for changing the volume comes up and gets in the way? Well, with this tweak it relocates that to the top of the screen in a concealed manner! Must have tweak!
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>Zeppelin:</b> If you look at the top left of your device, you'll se that it will show your carrier's name. Whether it be Verizon or nTelos. But, with Zeppelin (can be found in the Cydia search bar) you can change that text to whatever you want!
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>StatusBarWeather7:</b> This is a fairly simple tweak, as the name implies. Current weather conditions will appear at the status bar of your home screen. You can change the unit of measurement and how often it refreshes, etc.
</p>
</br>
<p>
	<font color="white"><b>Flurry:</b> If you slide up from the bottom on your home screen, the little thing will come up (where you can turn your flashlight on and off etc.). Now that you're there, take look at how dense it really looks. So, go ahead into the Cydia store and download flurry. Also, if you weren't sure what I meant earlier by how dense it looks, download the app, slide up, and you will see the difference.
