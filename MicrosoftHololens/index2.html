	<p><center>As you saw Microsoft unveil Windows 10, we witnessed something new, something totally not every thought of... HoloLens. Microsoft claims they have made a prototype for new device that will allow us to see thing you can see through a computer screen, through a holographic device that displays the same things as Windows 10. They would use the same processor as a computer and show everything a computer would, but instead of showing the images through a screen, it would use images provided by holographics only seen by the person with the headset on. When the person is talking through skype to a man who is helping her fix a sink. He sees nwhat she sees. He can edit what she sees because she sees what the hologram is showing. That means that peop-le talking through skype can edit what you see. Now you can show computer screens to instruct things better using arrows and such. All in all, this is a big step into the future what we all hope will be bright for technology and humankind itself.</center></p>
