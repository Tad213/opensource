	<p><center>As you saw Microsoft unveil Windows 10, we witnessed something new, something totally not every thought of... HoloLens. Microsoft claims they have made a prototype for new device that will allow us to see thing you can see through a computer screen, through a holographic device that displays the same things as Windows 10. They would use the same processor as a computer and show everything a computer would, but instead of showing the images through a screen, it would use images provided by holographics only seen by the person with the headset on. When the person is talking through skype to a man who is helping her fix a sink. With some swipes and points of a finger you can use Windows in a whole new and innovative way. He sees what she sees. He can edit what she sees because she sees what the hologram is showing. That means that people talking through skype can edit what you see. Now you can show computer screens to instruct things better using arrows and such. Even though we can all see that the commercial is most likely very exaggerated, all in all this is still a big push into what we hope is a bright future for technology and humankind. This is ProjectPSU reporting, Tootaloo.</center></p>
