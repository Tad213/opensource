	<p><center>As you saw Microsoft unveil Windows 10, we witnessed something new, something totally not every thought of... 
	HoloLens. Microsoft claims they have made a prototype for new device that will allow us to see thing you can see through a computer
	screen, through a holographic device that displays the same things as Windows 10. They would use the same processor as a computer
	and show everything a computer would, but instead of showing the images through a screen, it would use images provided by holographics
	only seen by the person with the headset on. When the person is talking through skype to a man who is helping her fix a sink.
	With some swipes and points of a finger you can use Windows in a whole new and innovative way. He sees what she sees. 
	He can edit what she sees because she sees what the hologram is showing. That means that people talking through skype can 
	edit what you see. Now you can show computer screens to instruct things better using arrows and such. Even though we can all 
	see that the commercial is most likely very exaggerated, all in all this is still a big push into what we hope is a bright future
	for technology and humankind. This is ProjectPSU reporting, Tootaloo.</center></p>

	<p><center>Update: as some of you may know this seems an aweful lot like the kenect unvailing that microsoft did a while back showing star treck like features
	but when it came out there was very little of what it clamed, I would love for this to happen and don't get me wrong eventualy i think it will I'm
	just not getting my hopes up to soon, but there have been some very good reviews if you do a quick google search but I would be kidding myself if I said that I
	thought there where going to be no flaws at all.</center></p>
