	Now I know what you are thinking if you know what a tulpa is, This guys freaking lost it he dosn't even know what he's talking about anymore.
	I know that there is no actual proof that these things exist but it does make alot of sence, I have yet to try it but I hope to at a later time and will
	tell you if it works, but we digress the reson I have these on here are because this website is about gaining root access to stuff and tulpas 
	are root access to your brain giving you a photographic memory. Unfortunatly I cannot give instructions here because I do not fully understaind it 
	but a quick google serch will give you plenty of results and I hope to latter post a form here but for now I just want to bring them to everybodys 
	attention.
