	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Now I know that there are people here who just want to hack there way to the top of the leader boards without dealing with
		bans, stealth patching, and all these wierd words like RGH, JTag and R-JTag and others who want to add to the mods that are
		live compatable. So you turned here and what this will do for you is let you start in hard modding without doing anything hard
		or dealing with expincive tools.
	</p>
	<h2>How To</h2>
	<p>
		Simply purchase a instafire kit from <a href="http://www.intensafirestore.com/products/intensafire-3-0-xbox-360-rapid-fire-mod">instafire store</a> and then solder it comes
		with instructions but the solder glue only last about a month so I sugest to invest in a soldering iron and learn to solder.
	</p>
	<h2>homemade</h2>
	<p>
		ok if you are a cheapskate like me or you want to be able to easyly and almost freely upgrade it this is the path for you
		this requires that you have a PIC12F683, a PIC programmer, wire and optionaly a 8 slot ic port while i won't be getting into
		now I will upload a vidio hopefully before the end of the month.
