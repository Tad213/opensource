		Flashing your drive allows you to simply place a DVD that you bought from a store for ~$2 and burned a iso for a xbox onto it
		and it works, without a flashed drive it will simply say that it cannot read the disk. This style is for xbox slims with a 
		hitachi or a liteon DG-16D5S if you have any other type of drive click <a href="flashing.html">here</a>.
